## Build Dependencies

Parity Ethereum requires **latest stable Rust version** to build.

We recommend installing Rust through [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/). If you don't already have `rustup`, you can install it like this:

- Linux:
  ```bash
  $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
  ```

  Parity Ethereum also requires `gcc`, `g++`, `pkg-config`, `file`, `make`, and `cmake` packages to be installed.

- OSX:
  ```bash
  $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
  ```

  `clang` is required. It comes with Xcode command line tools or can be installed with homebrew.

Once you have `rustup` installed, then you need to install:
* [Perl](https://www.perl.org)
* [Yasm](https://yasm.tortall.net)

Make sure that these binaries are in your `PATH`. After that, you should be able to build Parity Ethereum from source.

## Build from Source Code

```bash
$ cargo build --release --features final
```

This produces an executable in the `./target/release` subdirectory.
